## 🤖 What Are DeepFakes?

DeepFakes are synthetic media created using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques, where a person's likeness (face, voice, or body) is replaced or manipulated. The technology uses:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **Autoencoders**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Voice Synthesis**

### Applications

**Positive Uses:**
- Film and entertainment production
- Historical education
- Accessibility tools
- Art and creative expression
- Language dubbing

**Concerns:**
- Misinformation and fake news
- Identity theft
- Privacy violations
- Erosion of trust in media
